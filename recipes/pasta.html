        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Pasta, a cherished culinary classic originating from Italy, has become a global sensation. Crafted from a simple mix of wheat flour, water, and eggs, pasta boasts a myriad of shapes suitable for various recipes. Its adaptability makes it a favorite canvas for diverse sauces, proteins, and vegetables, contributing to its widespread appeal among both home cooks and professional chefs.</p>
        <p>Cooking pasta involves boiling it in salted water until achieving the sought-after al dente texture—firm to the bite yet tender. This crucial step, combined with pasta's versatility, allows it to pair seamlessly with a range of sauces, from hearty meat-based ragù to light and zesty tomato variations. Pasta's ability to harmonize with diverse flavors makes it a satisfying and universally enjoyed dish.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Semolina Flour</li>
            <li>Water (in addition to eggs or as an egg substitute)</li>
            <li>Durum Wheat Flour (common for certain pasta types)</li>
            <li>Olive Oil (for flavor and preventing sticking)</li>
            <li>Whole Wheat Flour (for a healthier option)</li>
            <li>Spinach or Tomato Puree (for flavored pasta)</li>
            <li>Herbs and Spices (such as basil, garlic, or pepper, for added flavor)</li>
            <li>Ricotta or Parmesan Cheese (for stuffed pasta)</li>
            <li>Cornmeal or Rice Flour (for dusting and preventing sticking during rolling/cutting)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>For a basic pasta dough, use approximately 2 cups of all-purpose flour for every 3 large eggs. Adjust as needed based on the number of servings.</li>
            <li>On a clean surface or in a large mixing bowl, create a mound with the flour. Make a well in the center.</li>
            <li>Crack the eggs into the well. If making eggless pasta, add water gradually while incorporating it into the flour.</li>
            <li>Using a fork or your fingers, gradually incorporate the flour into the eggs (or water) until a shaggy dough forms.</li>
            <li>Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 8-10 minutes, or until it becomes smooth and elastic. If the dough is too sticky, add more flour as needed.</li>
            <li>Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and let it rest for at least 30 minutes. This allows the gluten to relax, making the dough easier to roll.</li>
            <li>On a floured surface, roll out the rested dough to your desired thickness. Ensure it is evenly rolled.</li>
            <li>Cut the rolled-out dough into your preferred pasta shape, such as fettuccine, tagliatelle, or pappardelle.
            </li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the pasta for 2-4 minutes (depending on thickness) until al dente.</li>
            <li>Drain the pasta and toss it with your favorite sauce, or use it in your desired recipe.</li>
        </ol>
